# Flight-Price-Prediction

A Flight price prediction application that predicts fares of flights for a particular date based on various parameters like Source, Destination, Stops & Airline. Data used in this project is scraped from an online ticket booking website 'Ease my Trip' using a Python module name BeautifulSoup. The dataset goes through Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, and Exploratory Data Analysis which gives insights about the data and later uses Machine Learning techniques to train the data for prediction. It is a regression problem that is solved using RandomForestRegressor ML Algorithm which generates accurate results for price prediction. A web application is created using Flask through which users can interact and get accurate predictions of flight fares.
